        <h2>What does a Frontend Developer do? And why do I want to be one?</h2>
        Front End developers are the ones that deals with the visual components of websites and applications.
        If a website was a house, the frontend dev’s would be the interior designers.
        They are typically using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visually define how a website looks and responds to a user.
        If you have ever clicked on a menu and it drops down with a fancy animation, that is because a frontend dev has designed and implemented code to make that happen.
        <br>
        <br>
        I find this role appealing as it has a good balance of creativity and logical problem solving.
        It’s exciting to me that there is technically no correct way to make a website, and no one design that is better than another.
        It is just up to the developer to try and provide users with something that they will enjoy using, whilst also being able to add their own stylistic touches.

        <h2>What are the Skills, Qualifications, and Experience required to be a Frontend Developer?</h2>
        To be a Frontend Developer at a minimum you would need to have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three skills combined will allow you to create just about whatever you want in terms of websites. However to really be successful or at least competitive in the industry, you might need to have some deeper knowledge of web design frameworks, some understanding of basic Backend concepts, and the ability to learn and teach yourself new skills.<br><br>
        You do not necessarily require a qualification to become a Frontend Developer, but some specific roles may list it as a requirement, especially for roles that might involve working on apps or programs more complex than a simple website. <br><br>
        Experience and a decent portfolio would be the most important things when it comes to being a Frontend Developer, as these are what really sets you aside from everyone else. And allows you to prove you are good at what you do, and capable of implementing and finishing work.

        <h2>What are the Skills, Qualifications, and Experience that I need to get my ideal job.</h2>
        To be a competitive applicant for my ideal job I will need to continue to work on my existing skillset as JavaScript is definitely my weakest point, and I still have more to learn about HMTL and CSS. I will also need to develop more of an understanding of frameworks and learn some other time saving methods and techniques. <br><br>
        While I do not believe the qualifications are as important as the skills and experience. I am currently studying a Diploma of Information Technology Networking as well as this Bachelors of Information Technology, and believe these will also help me prove I have a broad understanding of the industry, and the ability to learn and complete work at a high standard.<br><br>
        I would like to begin to develop a develop a portfolio to detail my experience and prove I am capable of producing quality work. Ideally some group projects would also be useful for me to participate in as it will prove that I have experience working within a team.
