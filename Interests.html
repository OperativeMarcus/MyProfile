    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>What is my interest in IT</h2>
    I have been interested in information technology for as long as I can remember.<br>
    As a young child I remember my dad getting a new Windows 95 computer for work. <br>
    I would just sit there and watch him working, thinking to myself how cool it was that he didn’t have to write things down on paper. <br>
    As I grew older and started playing video games and using technology more frequently, I began to appreciate how incredible the world of IT really is, and how important it is to us as a society. <br>
    During high school I began to research and teach myself as much as I could, and I have fallen in love with IT and learning. There is something so liberating about being able to use technology efficiently to help achieve a goal.</p>

    
    <p>
        <h2>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
    I have been working in various IT roles for the last 7 years, during this time I have always considered further study and have spoken about it to various friends, co-workers and people in the industry.
    RMIT has been recommended to me consistently by these people, and when the time came to continue my studies, I knew that RMIT would be the best option for me.</p>

    
    <p>
        <h2>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h2>
        As much as possible.<br><br>
        
        I would really like to learn more about web design and coding, as I find coding to be a brilliant mix of creativity and logical problem solving.
        I already have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS as I recently began to do some web dev work on the side, so I have been spending a lot of time on stackexchange and github trying to get better at those three languages.
        Outside of those specific skills I just want to use all the resources and time I have available to absorb as much information as possible.
        I am also excited to be surrounded by other people who are passionate about learning, and hope to learn from other people’s own experiences.
