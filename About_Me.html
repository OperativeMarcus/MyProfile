<p>
My name is Marcus Keily,<br><br>
I am 25 years old and I currently live in Melbourne.<br>
I am originally from down in Gippsland, having grown up on a dairy farm near Moe.
<br><br>
I am Australian but my family is originally of Irish heritage, and I have a quirky Irish last name to prove it.<br> It is one of those names that no one can ever pronounce correctly. It might read as ‘keely’ but it is pronounced ‘kylie’.
<br><br>
My highest level of education is VCE as I had originally planned to do further studies fresh out of school, but I was offered a data entry role at a corporation based in Melbourne.<br> And as an 18 year old I could not turn down the income or the opportunity to move to the city.
<br><br>
Since moving to Melbourne I have spent the last 7 or so years working in various IT roles, where I have picked up a variety of skills and slowly found out I am passionate about coding and development.<br> Because of this I have decided to return to study and I am currently studying at both Diploma and Tertiary level.
<br><br>
Outside of IT my main hobby is photography.<br><br>
Here is a photo I took in Japan:<br>
