    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        Imagine an online advertisement portal with API endpoint access.
Advertisers, brands, and marketing agencies can login and upload advertising materials. Which can then be easily accessed and distributed through the API to real world billboards, online advertisements, in-game advertisements, or advertisements in blockbuster movies. Typically, smaller budget games and other media lack the ability to include advertisements and monetisation’s like this. It could be a valuable tool that allows advertisers to treat small indie studio’s as ‘micro influencers’ and using them to deliver their material to a more direct and niche audience.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        Have you ever played a video game, and realised that none of the products or advertisements you see in game are for real products? Have you ever watched a movie and seen real world products advertised directly to you? They’re never too distracting if done well and brands pay to have their products featured on the big screen. I believe that these same branding opportunities could potentially be implemented into video games in a smart, modern and connected way to provide users with a seamless advertising experience, allowing game developers to use their existing products to generate additional revenue.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        I am proposing a modern web application that can serve as a marketplace for hosting advertising material, with API endpoints to easily allow game developers or other web developers to to access and implement advertising content dynamically into their products or advertising spaces.
        This marketplace would aim to facilitate payments and smart delivery of content, and would have measures in place to accurately track user engagement and viewership. Imagine if billboards in real life or inside games could dynamically update to deliver content based on the types of people viewing them in real time. 
        <br><br>
        The web application would allow potential marketers to create an account and log in to a dashboard where they can upload and customise advertising content and create audience profiles. These profiles would then be used to match the advertising materials with the locations that they will be displayed. If a brand wants their content to be seen by people aged 40+ maybe real world advertisements would be the best option? If they want to advertise to people in their 20’s, the content can be delivered through billboards inside video games or other media favourable with the youth. The web application platform will need to provide a very deep level of customisation and targeting to ensure that it is competitive with other advertising platforms.
        <br><br>
        The database and API will allow for advertising material to be appropriately tagged for display. It will  allow for easy access to developers who wish to integrate advertisements into their products. It will also allow for streamlined reporting and data presentation to view the performance of the advertisements and determine when ads should be stopped or payment required to continue to deliver them.
        <br><br>
        Advertisers would potentially pay up front when creating ads within the online marketplace, providing advertising credit. Which would be used based on the amount of views or the time the advertisements have been displayed, there would need to be a way to track and measure this, but I am confident it could easily be tracked within a database.
        <br><br>
        It might also be worth having some sort of consulting service for larger advertising companies who wish to have a more streamlined and customised advertising experience, this type of customisation and personalisation to the needs of the advertisers could allow this app to cater to larger organisations and ensure they adopt this platform as a tool to advertise with, maybe partnering them with specific upcoming projects or products.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        I believe that for this type of project, a cloud provider like AWS or MS Azure might be the best solution for scalability when it comes to web hosting and data storage. This would allow us to store and deliver content globally without the issues you would face with creating and running your own data centres. The database will need to be designed in a way where it has functional API’s allowing for the sending and receiving of information. Additionally, a lightweight and sleek website will need to be developed to allow advertisers to upload media and track performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        The most essential part of this would be the website and the database.
        A solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be required to get the website up to a professional standard. And the database and API endpoints will require more specific knowledge especially if working with a cloud provider like AWS or Azure. I believe all of this knowledge is readily available and definitely possible to implement, however it might be best to either consult experts, or hire some knowledgeable staff members.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        If this project is successful, we would see a revolutionary way of advertising through modern media streams. It would potentially be a great revenue stream and could also assist small and medium sized developers to gain additional revenue, while allowing larger organisations to market to a new audience. As far as I am aware no marketing platform exists that caters to this idea, so it would be great to start working on this immediately.
