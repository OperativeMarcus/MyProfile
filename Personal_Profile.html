        <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
        These tests all indicate that I am very outgoing and personable, and that I am sure of who I am and know what I am good at. I love working within teams, and I love helping everyone be a part of a team so they can contribute to the success of a group. And I love creative problem solving and thinking outside the box to find abstract solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
        Having already experienced working in dynamic team environments I agree with the results of these tests and know that my outgoing personality can at times clash with others. Because of this I have found that it is important to find a team that you fit in with, where you can gel well with others and compliment existing strengths and weaknesses within the team. However I do believe that all personality tests should not be taken as gospel, and that anyone has the ability to fit into a team if they work hard to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
        When forming a team, I tend to try and pick people that will compliment my personality. I do not like to have too many people that want to be the leader or be demanding and not willing to listen to others.
        I tend to enjoy working with more introverted people and using my voice to help speak for them.
        Some people find it difficult to speak up or make themselves heard, but their ideas and contributions are just as important to the success of a group.
